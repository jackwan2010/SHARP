SHARP: Single-cell RNA-Seq Hyper-fast and Accurate clustering via ensemble Random Projection

SHARP is a bioinformatics tool to process and analyze single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA) data  in a hyper-fast and accurate way. It can process a scRNA dataset of 47,000+ single cells within several minutes with accurate clustering performance. 

Briefly speaking, SHARP integrates the following algorithms and techniques to achieve both efficient and effective performance: (1) divide-and-conquer strategy; (2) random-projection based dimension reduction; (3) ensemble learning for both meta-clustering of results from different random projections and of those from different partitions of large-scale datasets; (4) weighted ensemble clustering for tackling difficult-to-cluster single cells and (5) similarity-based meta-clustering for combining results of different mutually-exclusive single-cell groups.
